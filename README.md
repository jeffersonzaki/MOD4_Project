# Human Freedom Index 
Using the human freedom index, this project assessed the relationships between freedom and other social , political and economic factors that impact a countryâ€™s freedom index score. Using regression model, we are aiming to understand phenomenons that have a strong correlation with a higher freedom score.

## Project Scenario
We are a non government organization that conduct research and generate action to prevent abuses of human rights and to demand justice for those whose rights have been violated. We are approaching the United Nations Development Programme to help guide aide to where it is most needed using the recent human freedom index score.Over the past 5 years the Human Freedom Index score, for many countries has decreased. Our study aims to find significant contributors of freedom globally, as it is measured by the human freedom index score variables.
